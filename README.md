# Current-Global-Grain-Demand-EDA-
Grains are the world's most staple food. However, grains are produced on a seasonal basis in most regions in the world. Grains are also consumed all year long with fairly stable demand. The exploratory data analysis conducted in this notebook is therefore important for farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders. The EDA analyses the food grain demand, other grain demanded, grain produced per region and implied additional demand. The EDA thus gives a holistic picture of the deficit or surplus that regions have and provide a basis on which to support production.
